### 👋 Hello and Welcome to My GitHub Page 🎉

</div>

Hi there! I'm **Marek Holik**, a **Data Analyst intern** and an **Applied Mathematics student** at Slovak Technical University.  

With work and studies being my top priorities, my personal projects often take a backseat. However, I’ve invested significant effort into creating, reviewing, and refining them as time allows. 

While I’m unable to share the projects I’ve worked on during my internship or proprietary algorithms developed for personal use, this repository showcases the projects I’ve designed to represent my skills and expertise. 

These projects demonstrate my ability to act as a Junior Developer, with hands-on experience in designing and implementing solutions. Many feature a combination of back-end processes and front-end UI, focusing on clean, functional, and scalable code.

### 📂 Projects  

- ✅ I've reviewed approximately **50% of the projects** I worked on during my studies in Bratislava and Prague.  
- ✨ While not all are polished to perfection, I remain committed to continuously improving them.
